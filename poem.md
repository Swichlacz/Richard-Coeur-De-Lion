**Richard the First, Coeur-de-Lion,**

Is a name that we speak of with pride,

Though he only lived six months in England

From his birth to the day that he died. 

<br>He spent all his time fighting battles,<br> 
<br>Dressed up in most rigid attire,<br>
<br>For he had his suits made by the Blacksmith,<br>
<br>And his underwear knitted of wire.<br>

*He married a lady from Flanders,* 
*Berengaria's what they called her;* 
*She turned out a good wife to Richard,*
*In spite of a name like that there.* 

* For when he came home from his fighting 
* She'd bandage the wounds in his sconce, 
* And every time a snake bit him 
* She'd suck out the poison at once. 

*In their 'ouse they'd a minstrel called Blondel*

*To amuse them at t'end of the day'*

*And the King had but one thing against him...*

*He had nobbut one tune he could play.* 

<li>The Queen saw nowt wrong with the number<li> 
<liAnd would have it again and again,<li>
<li>And when Richard said: "Put a sock in it!"<li> 
<li>She'd give 'im a look full of pain.<li> 

<li>The King got fed up at the finish,<li> 
<li>And were so sick of 'earing it played,<li> 
<li>That he packed his spare suit on a wagon<li> 
<li>And went off and joined the Crusade.<li>

<li>He got fighting the moment he landed,<li>
<li>And though Saracen lads did their best,<li> 
<li>He cut off their heads in such numbers,<li> 
<li>That the hatmakers lodged a protest.<li> 

<li>The Sultan, whose name were Saladin,<li> 
<li>Thought he'd best try this business to stem,<li>
<li>So he rode up to Richard and told him<li> 
<li>He mustn't do that there to them.<li> 

<li>Said Richard: "Oh! Who's going to stop me?"<li> 
<li>Said Saladin: "I will-and quick!"<li> 
<li>So the King poked his sword at the Sultan,<li> 
<li>Who, in turn, swiped his skimpter at Dick.<li> 

<li>They fought all that day without ceasing;<li> 
<li>They fought till at last they both saw<li> 
<li>That each was a match for the other,<li> 
<li>So they chucked it and called it a draw.<li> 

<li>As Richard rode home in the moonlight<li> 
<li>He heard someone trying to croon,<li> 
<li>And there by the roadside stood Blondel,<li> 
<li>Still playing his signature tune.<li> 

<li>He'd worked out his passage from England<li> 
<li>In search of his Master and Lord,<li> 
<li>And had swum the last part of the journey<li> 
<li>'Cos his tune got 'im thrown overboard.<li> 

<li>This meeting filled Richard with panic:<li> 
<li>He rode off and never drew rein<li> 
<li>Till he got past the Austrian border<li> 
<li>And felt he could breathe once again.<li> 

<li>He hid in a neighbouring Castle,<li>
<li>But he hadn't been there very long<li> 
<li>When one night just outside his window<li> 
<li>Stood Blondel, still singing his song.<li> 

<li>This 'ere took the heart out of Richard;<li>
<li>He went home dejected and low,<li> 
<li>And the very next fight he got into<li> 
<li>He were killed without striking a blow.<li>
<li>Marriott Edgar<li>
